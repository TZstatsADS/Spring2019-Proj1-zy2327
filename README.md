### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: How Background Affects Happiness
+ This project is conducted by Zeyu Yang

+ Project summary: People with different background often have different sense of happiness. A child may think of eating candies or visiting zoo as happy. A young person may think of being admitted by a dream university as happy. Age along with other factors such as gender, parenthood and so on could greatly change the way people think of happiness. This data story is going to find out how background(age, gender and parenthood) affect happiness.
