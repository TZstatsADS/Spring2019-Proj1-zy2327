### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: __How Background Affects Happiness__
+ This project is conducted by __Zeyu Yang__

+ Project summary: People with different background often have different sense of happiness. A child may think of eating candies or visiting zoo as happy. A young person may think of being admitted by a dream university as happy. Age along with other factors such as gender, parenthood and so on could greatly change the way people think of happiness. This data story is going to find out how background(age, gender and parenthood) affect happiness.

+ Project finding:
  
  * All age groups mainly express feeling about positve, trust, joy and anticipation.

  * Boyfriend and girlfriend are mentioned most by 10-20 age group; husband, wife, son and daughter are mentioned more in the rest age groups. Friend and family are the keywords to all age groups.

  * "Father" tends to mentioned more about "work" while "mother" tends to mentioned more about family.
