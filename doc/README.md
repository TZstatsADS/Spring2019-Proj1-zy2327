# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains a Rmd file and a html file. The Rmd file contains the code for building the html file. The html file is the presentation.

In the Rmd file, it will first install the required packages and then run the code. It may take some time to complete running the entire code.

Since the Rmd file is using the data from *data* folder, please __make sure the *data* folder has been downloaded__.
